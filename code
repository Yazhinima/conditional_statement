# problem 1: Given two numbers, print their sum. However, if the two numbers are the same, return double their sum.
num1 = 20
num2 = 20

if num1 != num2:
    print("the sum of the two different number is : ", num1+num2) 
else:
    print("the doubled value of the two num is : ", 2 * (num1+num2))
num1 = 20
num2 = 20

if num1 != num2:
    print("the sum of the two different number is : ", num1+num2) 
else:
    print("the doubled value of the two num is : ", 2 * (num1+num2))

the doubled value of the two num is :  80

# 2 Given a Cost price and Selling price of a product,write program to calculate profit or loss
cost_price = 1000
selling_price = 4000

profit = selling_price - cost_price
loss = cost_price - selling_price

if selling_price > cost_price:
    print("Profit for the product is : ", (profit/cost_price) * 100, "%")
elif cost_price > selling_price:
    print("Loss for the product is : ", (loss/cost_price) * 100, "%")
else:
    print("No gain or loss, the product sold at the cost_price ")


Profit for the product is :  300.0 %

# 3 Write a program to input basic salary of an employee and calculate gross salary according to given conditions. 
Basic Salary <= 10000 : HRA = 20%, DA = 80% 
Basic Salary is between 10001 to 20000 : HRA = 25%, DA = 90% Basic Salary >= 20001 : HRA = 30%, DA = 95%

basic_salary = int(input("Enter your basic salary : "))

salary1_10k = (basic_salary + basic_salary * (20/100) + basic_salary * (80/100))
salary2_20k = (basic_salary + basic_salary * (25/100) + basic_salary * (90/100))
salary3_30k = (basic_salary + basic_salary * (30/100) + basic_salary * (95/100))

if basic_salary <= 10000:
    print("The gross salary is : ", salary1_10k)
elif basic_salary >= 10001 and basic_salary <= 20000:
    print("The gross salary is : ", salary2_20k)
elif basic_salary >= 20001:
    print("The gross salary is : ", salary3_30k)
else:
    print("Please enter a valid amount.")

Enter your basic salary : 25000
The gross salary is :  56250.0

# 4 Write a program to check if given year is leap year or not. 
Leap year : A year is said to be leap year, if the year is exactly divisible by 4 but and not divisible by 100

year = int(input("enter the year to find is it leap year or not : "))

if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0:
    print("The year you entered is a leap year.")
else:
    print("This is not a leap year.")

enter the year to find is it leap year or not : 2020
The year you entered is a leap year.

# 5 Write a program to check whether triangle is equilateral, scalene or isosceles 
A triangle is said Equilateral Triangle, if all its sides are equal. If a, b, c are three sides of triangle. 
Then, the triangle is equilateral only if a == b == c.
A triangle is said Isosceles Triangle, if its two sides are equal. If a, b, c are three sides of triangle. Then, the     
triangle is isosceles if either a == b or a == c or b == c.
A triangle is said Scalene Triangle, if none of its sides are equal.

a_side = 10
b_side = 20
c_side = 30

if a_side == b_side == c_side:
    print("""This is a "Equilateral Triangle". """)
elif a_side == b_side or b_side == c_side or a_side == c_side:
    print("""This is a "Isoceles Triangle". """)
else:
    print("""This is a "scalene Triangle". """)
    
This is a "scalene Triangle".
